## Quick start

Ensure that you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Version 16 or later) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (Version 7.x) installed.

Then execute the following commands to get started:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/open-pioneer/starter.git # Clone the repository
$ pnpm install                                          # Install dependencies
$ pnpm run dev                                          # Launch development server
```

Vite will print the project's local address (usually <http://localhost:5173/>).
Point your browser at it and start programming!
