By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n          NO WARRANTY\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.",

For the purposes of this definition,\n      \"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the\n      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or\n      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the\n      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\n      \"You\" (or \"Your\") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity\n      exercising permissions granted by this License.\n      \"Source\" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,\n      including but not limited to software source code, documentation\n      source, and configuration files.\n      \"Object\" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical\n      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but\n      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,\n      and conversions to other media types.\n      \"Work\" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or\n      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\n      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\n      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\n      \"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\n      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\n      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\n      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\n      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n      \"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including\n      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\n      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\n      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\n      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\n      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, \"submitted\"\n      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent\n      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to\n      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,\n      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\n      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\n      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\n      designated in writing by the copyright owner as \"Not a Contribution.\"\n      \"Contributor\" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\n      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\n      subsequently incorporated within the Work.\n   2. Grant of Copyright License.

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN\n    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS\n    INFORMATION ON AN \"AS-IS\" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES\n    REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS\n    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM\n    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED\n    HEREUNDER.\nStatement of Purpose\nThe laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer\nexclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator\nand subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an \"owner\") of an original work of\nauthorship and/or a database (each, a \"Work\").\nCertain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for\nthe purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and\nscientific works (\"Commons\") that the public can reliably and without fear\nof later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other\nworks, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever\nand for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.\nThese owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free\nculture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific\nworks, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in\npart through the use and efforts of others.\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any\nexpectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person\nassociating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she\nis an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily\nelects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its\nterms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the\nWork and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not\nlimited to, the following:\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,\n     communicate, and translate a Work;\n ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\niii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or\n     likeness depicted in a Work;\n iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data\n     in a Work;\n vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n     protection of databases, and under any national implementation\n     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such\n     directive); and\nvii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the\n     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national\n     implementations thereof.\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention\nof, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,\nirrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of\nAffirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes\nof action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as\nfuture claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories\nworldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or\ntreaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future\nmedium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,\nincluding without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional\npurposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each\nmember of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and\nsuccessors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to\nrevocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or\nequitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public\nas contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason\nbe judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the\nWaiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into\naccount Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the\nextent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected\nperson a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\nirrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and\nRelated Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\nmaximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future\ntime extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number\nof copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without\nlimitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the\n\"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was\napplied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any\nreason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such\npartial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder\nof the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she\nwill not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related\nRights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of\naction with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's\nexpress Statement of Purpose.\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or\n    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,\n    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of\n    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non\n    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or\n    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to\n    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the\n    Work.\n d.
